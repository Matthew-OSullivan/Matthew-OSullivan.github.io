    <p>
        My name is Matthew O'Sullivan but I preferred to be called Matt. I'm a junior at <a
            href="http://www.babson.edu" target="_blank">Babson College</a> and
        I'm concentrating in Operations Management and Environmental Sustainability. Although my career
        interests lie in Operations, I'm very interested in coding and have taken several classes throughout
        high school into college to advance my knowledge. I'm taking a lot of Operations classes including a Python
        class and a Business Intelligence course. After graduating, I plan to move to New York and
        eventually become a manager at a firm which values my concentrations. I'm not sure which firm I am going to
        work for, but as long as they respect me and give me opportunities to grow then I will be happy with that.
        Ideally, I would want to work for a company which provides real world solutions to the issues of the global
        rising of temperatures.

        I love participating in some sort of athletic sport or exercise. I became a swimmer at the
        age of 6 and competed until I was 18 years old. My favourite stroke is breastroke but I'm good at freestyle
        and I.M. Some of the accolades I'm proud to have achieved were competing in British Nationals and English
        Nationals from ages 16-18 as well as being recruited by multiple colleges to swim for them. In the end, I
        chose to attend Babson and no longer continue swimming as my desire to learn was being inhibited by the
        demands of being a student-athlete. I tried out volleyball for a year and noticed that my heart was not into
        that sport either. I enjoyed the team aspect, but I found that individual sports are more up my alley. Now,
        I started running. My goal is to run a half-marathon this summer and I'm very excited to reach that goal
        every day I step on the treadmill.
